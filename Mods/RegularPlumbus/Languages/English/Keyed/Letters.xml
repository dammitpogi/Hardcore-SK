  <LetterFleebPasses>A small group of fleebs seems to have wandered into the area.\n\nFleebs are small, bouncing spongelike creatures. As a part of their biology they produce a clear, purple psychoactive fluid called fleeb juice, as a means of storing energy and to ward off predators.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the properties of their fluids are highly sought after both for recreational and industrial purposes, making them a target for hunters.\n\nThe fleebs will leave the area in a few days.</LetterFleebPasses>
